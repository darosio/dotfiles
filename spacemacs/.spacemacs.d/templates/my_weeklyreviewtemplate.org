    - [X] Review my annual goals @2DO
      https://michaelhyatt.com/the-importance-of-the-weekly-review/ They represent
      my priority projects. I review them weekly (in addition to daily) in order
      to ensure that I don’t lose visibility on what matters most. I specifically
      make sure I have identified the appropriate next action and then put it in
      my task management system or on my calendar.

      - FIXME maybe remove all todo states
      - “What do I really need to accomplish this week?” Like goals, I either
        identity the next action and assign a due date for the day in the upcoming
        week I want to work on it or I schedule it on my calendar.
      - proj by proj “<” “^” Evaluate status of projects, goals and outcomes, one by
        one, ensuring at least one current action item on each.
      - Browse through project plans, support material, and any other
        work-in-progress material to trigger new actions, completions, waiting
        for's, etc.
      - FIXME! Here C-c a m WORK/PERSONAL might highlight something needing attention
        and highlight per project “<”. items (tagged?) not TODO are also listed.

    - [X] Review Waiting-For List. (C-c a m WAITING) [1/1]
      - Record appropriate actions for any needed follow-up. Check off received
        ones.
      - This is a list of items I have delegated to others and are important enough
        to track. If something is overdue, or if I need a progress report, I send an
        e-mail and nudge the person responsible. I note in the task itself that I
        sent a reminder.
      - [X] Review TODO items in Waiting State  C-c a T W <tab> 2DO FIXME: dedicated agenda window?

    - [X] Write a short summary of the week (C-c r a)
      - [X] %U Create short Journal entry of what was bad & good last week
  - [X] Get *Creative*[4/4]]
    - [X] Review my [[file:~/Sync/share/phone/box/notes/someday.org::*Someday][Someday]], HOLD tags and Idea lists =, a i=
      - Review for any projects which may now have become active.
      - Is a Someday/Maybe becoming a task/project?
      - If a Someday is no longer of interest set it to "Cancelled".
    - [X] Review IDEAs !! 2DO
    - [X] Be Creative and Couragous FIXME

  # http://members.optusnet.com.au/~charles57/GTD/gtd_workflow.html
  
  The heart of the GTD process is a weekly review of:
  - all projects
  - Next Action lists
  - Waiting for Items. 
    
  Each project is checked to ensure that a next action has been defined.
  
  You might use clock-in & clock-out to record the time for this.
  
  Select all and toggle with =C-c C-x C-b=.

*** - start work (TO BE Removed)

     # http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html
      - daily agenda first - knock off items =potrebbe essere la tua action list=
    -[ ]] Look at entire agenda for today  =F12 SPC=
      - then work on NEXT tasks
